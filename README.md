# recipe-constructor

This was an example of using a constructor to organize information as an object and then saving the information into an array.

I created a program that allows you to enter in recipes. You type in the food you are creating, the ingredients needed to create the food, and steps needing to be done in order to complete the food creation.

Once an item is added, it send the information through the constructor and is saved in an array to it can be accessed again later. The recipes are divided into four different arrays:
breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks. When the user is looking for a recipe they added, all they need to do is click on the one of the four options for time it is typically prepared at. This will
populate buttons with the name of the foods which have been added for that particular time of day. When then food button is click it will populate all the information needed to make it in the bottom portion of the program.

There can be a max of 24 recipes added to each time frame.

This was created as an example for using a constructor. 

The styling of the website will be improved as time goes on.
Going forward I plan to implement this into a program using mySQL database to save data.
